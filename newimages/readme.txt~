** A README about note naming **
********************************

All note images are named using the following convention:

note.time.octave.version.extension

where
 
 - note is a lowercase letter from a to g
 - time is a lowercase letter such that
	- e = eigth	
	- q = quarter
	- h = half
	- w = whole
 - octave is an integer from -9 to 9, where 0 is the first octave
 - version is a natural number that is iterated for each new version
 - extension is the file extension

using this convention will allow the program to easily iterate though each note.
